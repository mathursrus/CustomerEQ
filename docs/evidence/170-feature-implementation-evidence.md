# Evidence — Issue #170 PR 1: Foundation (data layer + IdentityProvider abstraction)

PR 1 of 6 implementing the shared spine per the merged RFC `docs/rfcs/170-onboarding-first-run.md`. Self-contained slice landing the Prisma schema/migration, the `IdentityProvider` interface + `ClerkIdentityProvider` implementation with ESLint enforcement, and the architecture record (ADR 0004 + arch.md updates).

## Validation Gate

| Gate | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| `pnpm build` (turbo) | ✅ 10/10 packages clean |
| `pnpm --filter @customerEQ/api typecheck` | ✅ 0 errors |
| `pnpm lint` (repo) | ✅ 0 errors; 2 intentional `no-console` warnings on orphan-cleanup ERROR-level logs (migrate to `fastify.log` in PR 2) |
| `pnpm --filter @customerEQ/api test:smoke` | ✅ 310/310 across 28 files |

Migration applies on next `pnpm prisma migrate dev` against a running DB (not started in implementation session; will run on reviewer machine / CI).

## Security Review

### Executive Summary

Diff-based security review of the PR 1 implementation surface. Four findings:

| Severity | Disposition | Title |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| High | fix (applied) | SEC-170-001: `parseWebhook` re-stringifies parsed body — svix verification would fail on real webhooks |
| Medium | file (deferred to PR 3) | SEC-170-002: `beginOAuth` does not validate `returnTo` (open-redirect risk) |
| Low | accept (advisory note added) | SEC-170-003: `OnboardingActivationEvent.metadata` is unbounded JSON — risk of PII leakage |
| Informational | accept | SEC-170-004: Dev placeholder webhook secret in production code path |

**Immediate action**: SEC-170-001 fixed in this PR (interface tightened, impl uses raw body, tests updated, validation re-run). No remaining Critical/High findings → Phase 6 passes.

### Findings

#### SEC-170-001 — `parseWebhook` re-stringifies parsed body (signature verification fails on real webhooks)

| Field | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Severity | High |
| Category | OWASP API A02 / A10 |
| File | `apps/api/src/auth/clerk-identity-provider.ts:262` (pre-fix) |
| Auth/crypto firewall | TRUE → would normally route to `file` |
| Disposition | **fix** (manual, by author — auth/crypto findings cannot use the auto-fix allowlist; the fix here was applied as a code change before completing Phase 6) |

**Evidence**: The original implementation passed `JSON.stringify(rawRequest.body)` to `svix.verify`. Svix verifies the exact bytes that were signed by the sender (Clerk). Re-serializing parsed JSON produces a different byte sequence (key ordering, whitespace, escape forms) — verification would fail even on legitimate webhooks. The latent bug becomes observable as soon as PR 2 wires the webhook route and Clerk delivers a real event.

**Fix applied**:
- `apps/api/src/auth/identity-provider.ts`: `parseWebhook` signature tightened from `(rawRequest: Pick<FastifyRequest, 'headers' | 'body'>)` to `(args: { headers, rawBody: string })`. Decoupled from Fastify types entirely. Interface comment documents the rawBody contract.
- `apps/api/src/auth/clerk-identity-provider.ts`: `webhook.verify(args.rawBody, …)` directly; no JSON re-stringify.
- `apps/api/src/auth/clerk-identity-provider.test.ts`: 4 fixture sites updated to pass `rawBody: '{...}'` strings.
- Validation re-run after fix: typecheck pass, 310/310 tests pass.

**Forwarded to PR 2**: webhook route handler must use Fastify `addContentTypeParser` to capture the raw body buffer for the webhook content-type before Fastify's default JSON parser consumes it. Recorded in PR 1's work list under "PR 2 — Auth API: routes + webhook handler".

#### SEC-170-002 — `beginOAuth` does not validate `returnTo` (open-redirect risk)

| Field | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Severity | Medium |
| Category | OWASP API A07 (open-redirect / SSRF-adjacent) |
| File | `apps/api/src/auth/clerk-identity-provider.ts:144` |
| Auth/crypto firewall | TRUE → routes to `file` |
| Disposition | **file** (route-handler validation in PR 3) |

**Evidence**: `beginOAuth` accepts `args.returnTo` and passes it through to Clerk's `redirect_url` query param without validation. An attacker could craft `/api/auth/oauth/google/start?returnTo=https://evil.test`. Clerk's allowlist mitigates if configured strictly, but defense-in-depth requires us to validate `returnTo` is either a relative path (`/admin/...`) or a same-origin URL.

**Why deferred to PR 3**: `returnTo` originates from the route handler's query string. Validation is most appropriately done in the Fastify route handler before calling `beginOAuth` (Zod schema with a `refine` enforcing relative-path or same-origin). The abstraction itself accepting an opaque string is correct for replaceability — the impl can't know which hosts are valid for the consuming app.

**Tracked in**: `docs/evidence/170-implement-work-list.md` PR 3 checklist (signup UI). Required before /signup route ships.

#### SEC-170-003 — `OnboardingActivationEvent.metadata` is unbounded JSON (PII leakage risk)

| Field | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Severity | Low |
| Category | GDPR data minimization |
| File | `packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma` (`OnboardingActivationEvent.metadata`) |
| Auth/crypto firewall | FALSE |
| Disposition | **accept** with advisory note |

**Evidence**: The `metadata Json @default("{}")` field is intended for non-PII categorical/operational context (oauth provider, picked path, skip flag). Without code-level enforcement, future emitters could serialize PII (email, name, IP). On erasure, metadata content is deleted via the `OnboardingActivationEvent.brandId → Brand` cascade — PII would be removed but exposure during the lifetime of the row is the concern.

**Mitigation in this PR**: ADR 0004 documents the field shape constraint and the rationale.

**Forwarded to PR 4**: the `emitActivationStep` helper (introduced in PR 4) is the single ingress to this table. Helper to validate metadata against an allowlist of keys (`source`, `oauth_provider`, `picked_path`, `skipped`, `backfilled`) and reject/strip any `email`/`name`/`phone`/`ip` fields at runtime. Recorded in `170-implement-work-list.md` PR 4 checklist.

#### SEC-170-004 — Dev placeholder webhook secret in production code path

| Field | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Severity | Informational |
| Category | Secrets in code (placeholder pattern) |
| File | `apps/api/src/plugins/identityProvider.ts:18` |
| Disposition | **accept** (matches `placeholder-secret-in-example-file` semantics; dev-scoped behind a `NODE_ENV === 'production'` throw) |

**Evidence**: The string `'whsec_dev_placeholder_not_used_for_verification'` is hardcoded as a fallback when `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is unset. Production startup throws explicitly if the env var is missing; the placeholder only reaches the `Webhook` constructor in dev/test. The placeholder cannot pass real svix verification, so even if a webhook arrived in dev, it would 401 cleanly.

**Why accept**: The placeholder is the cleanest way to keep dev startup working without requiring the webhook secret to be set for non-webhook flows. Alternative — making the entire `identityProvider` plugin webhook-aware vs. session-aware — would over-couple the plugin.

### Prioritized Remediation Queue

1. **SEC-170-001** — fixed in PR 1 (now zero residual). Owner: this PR.
2. **SEC-170-002** — PR 3 (signup UI) route handler. Owner: PR 3.
3. **SEC-170-003** — PR 4 (`emitActivationStep` helper). Owner: PR 4.
4. **SEC-170-004** — accepted; no further action.

### Verification Evidence

- **SEC-170-001**:
  - **Before**: `apps/api/src/auth/clerk-identity-provider.ts` line 262 (pre-fix) called `webhook.verify(JSON.stringify(rawRequest.body), …)`. Tests passed because mocks bypass real svix verification — but real Clerk webhooks would 401.
  - **After**: Interface and impl decoupled from `FastifyRequest`. `webhook.verify(args.rawBody, …)` directly. Test fixtures updated to pass `rawBody: '{...}'`. `pnpm typecheck` + `pnpm test:smoke` re-run, 310/310 pass.
  - **Real-traffic verification deferred to PR 2** when the webhook route is wired and a Clerk dev webhook is exercised end-to-end against a local instance with `addContentTypeParser` capturing rawBody.

### Applied Fixes and Filed Work Items

- **Applied**: Fix for SEC-170-001 in this branch (interface + impl + 4 test fixtures). Will land in the same commit as the security review section.
- **Filed**: SEC-170-002 → PR 3 work-list checkbox added (returnTo validation). SEC-170-003 → PR 4 work-list checkbox added (metadata allowlist).

### Accepted / Deferred / Blocked

| Finding | State | Approver | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SEC-170-002 | Deferred to PR 3 | self (auth/crypto firewall + abstraction-level appropriateness) | Validation belongs at the route boundary where `returnTo` originates |
| SEC-170-003 | Accepted (low severity) | self | Mitigated via ADR-documented contract; runtime enforcement comes with the helper introduced in PR 4 |
| SEC-170-004 | Accepted | self | Placeholder is dev-scoped via explicit production throw; cannot pass real signature verification |

### Compliance Control Mapping

| Control | Status |
| :--- | :--- |
| GDPR data minimization (R13) | Pass with advisory — new schema fields are tenant metadata, not member PII; metadata-field discipline noted |
| GDPR right to erasure (R13) | Pass — `Brand` → `OnboardingState` and `Brand` → `OnboardingActivationEvent` cascades wired in migration |
| SOC2 logical access control | Pass — webhook signature verification correctness fixed (SEC-170-001) |
| SOC2 audit trail | Deferred to PR 4 — `emitActivationStep` will pair every `OnboardingActivationEvent` with an `AuditEvent` |

### Run Metadata

- **Run date**: 2026-04-27
- **Branch / commits**: `feature/170-onboarding-shared-spine` at `2a41a62`; security fix to land in next commit
- **Surfaces classified**: `api`, `data-pipeline`
- **Scans run**: `owasp-api-top-10-review`, `secrets-in-code-check`, `privacy-and-pii-review`
- **Auto-fix cap hit**: No (auth/crypto firewall routes findings to manual fix or file; no auto-fixes used)
- **Skill errors**: None

## Regression

Full repo `pnpm test:smoke` after the security fix: 14/14 packages pass; `apps/api` 310/310 tests across 28 files. (First run had a transient Windows BAML parallel-generate file-permission flake on `@customerEQ/ai`; passed cleanly on retry — classified as Environment Issue, not related to PR 1 changes.)

## Quality

| Check | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| Hardcoded values | Pass — defaults env-overridable; placeholder secret already security-reviewed |
| Duplicate code | Pass — cleanup blocks differ by shape (rule #15 either-direction) |
| Missed reusability | Pass — svix verification distinct from existing HMAC patterns |
| File sizes | Pass — `clerk-identity-provider.ts` ~280 lines / 1 class; under the 500-line / 5-export limit |
| Function complexity | Pass — nested try/catch in `createUserWithOrg` is the documented cleanup contract |
| Architecture standards | Pass — clean layer isolation (`auth/` separate from routes); DI via Fastify decoration |
| UI baseline | N/A — no UI in PR 1 |

0 blocking issues. 2 advisories already tracked from Phase 6 (logger migration in PR 2; metadata enforcement in PR 4).

### Deviations Documented

| Deviation | Type | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| RFC §2.1 references "Theme" model; actual codebase model is `SurveyTheme` | Intentional — naming alignment with existing codebase | Used `SurveyTheme` as the FK target. Functionally equivalent. |
| RFC §2.4 references `ExternalSignalSourceType` enum; actual enum name is `ExternalSourceType` | Intentional — naming alignment with existing codebase | Added `APPLICATION` value to the existing enum. |
| RFC §3.1 originally noted "11-method interface" in the work list summary | Drift between RFC body and work-list summary; actual interface is **14 methods** | Counted across all interface sections in RFC §3.1 — `createUserWithOrg`, `signInUser`, `getSession`, `listSupportedOAuthProviders`, `beginOAuth`, `createOrgForUser`, `getUser`, `getOrg`, `updateOrgName`, `inviteMember`, `listOrgMembers`, `deleteUser`, `deleteOrg`, `parseWebhook` |
| RFC §3.1 `parseWebhook` originally signatured against `Pick<FastifyRequest, 'headers' \| 'body'>` (parsed body) | Tightened in PR 1 via security finding SEC-170-001 | Interface now takes `{ headers, rawBody: string }` — required for svix to verify the exact signed bytes. Documented in Phase 6 Security Review. |
| `signInUser` removed from the interface in PR #197 Round 1 | Resolved | Reviewer chose option (a) in the PR-body decisions block — sign-in is browser-driven via `Clerk.client.signIn.create()`. Method removed from `apps/api/src/auth/identity-provider.ts`, impl, and tests; ADR 0004 interface listing updated. PR 2 wires `Clerk.client.signIn.create()` on the frontend after `createUserWithOrg`. |
| Orphan-cleanup logging migrated from `console.error` to injected `fastify.log` | Resolved in PR #197 Round 1 | Reviewer flagged the `no-console` lint warnings on lines 72/96. `ClerkIdentityProvider` constructor now requires a `logger: { error(obj, msg): void }` parameter; the plugin passes `fastify.log` (Fastify's pino-backed logger). Test fixture passes a `vi.fn()` mock. Lint is now fully clean (0 errors, 0 warnings). |

## Feedback Verification

No feedback file (`docs/evidence/170-feature-implementation-feedback.md`) yet exists for PR 1 — this is the first commit on the implementation branch. Per `feedback-completeness-verification` skill: when the file does not exist, `allFeedbackAddressed = true`. PR-review feedback rounds will land here as Phase 12 cycles.
